# Weather App - React Native

This React Native mobile app fetches and displays real-time weather data from an external API, providing users with the latest weather conditions for various locations. Users can search for a city to view current weather details, making it an excellent project for learning how to work with APIs and implementing navigation in React Native.

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data from an external API.
- Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Allows users to search for weather details by city.
- Smooth and responsive navigation for an intuitive user experience.
